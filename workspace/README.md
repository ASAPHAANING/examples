# Neon Workspace Example

Workspaces are a very powerful feature in cargo. However, it takes
a little extra work to use them with Neon.

## Problem

The neon-cli expects the shared library generated by cargo to be
in (`native/target`)[https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/issues/297].
However, when adding a workspace config to the root of the project, the
default target directory will also be at the root of the project.

## Workaround

Fortunately, this problem as a simple workaround. Cargo can be instructed
to use `native/target` instead of `target` by adding the following
config to `.cargo/config`.

```toml
[build]
target-dir = "native/target"
```

## Limitation

Since it is only possible to have a single target location, it is not
possible for a workspace to include multiple neon modules.

## Usage

```sh
cargo check
cargo test
npm i
node .
```
